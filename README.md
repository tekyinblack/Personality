# Add-on Robot Personality
The purpose of the code in this repository is to run a MAX7219 based matrix displays to provide a visual
output from a robot, or just for standalone fun, with output described in files.
The original version is based on Raspberry Pi Pico

An example of a test control file is provided, Waving example.txt, where the robot waves its arms and a test
checkerboard is displayed.  A description of the syntax is also included. The files can be used to show just a single image or setup to provide a degree of 
animation.
